Add:
	Add will always have only 2 inputs and 1 output as per the vhd file.
	Add uses join internally to make sure that it has both the operands ready before adding.
	So for implementing And, Join has to be implemented.
	
Ret:
	1 input and 1 output always
	Internally, it is exactly same as TEHB
	
TEHB:
	N inputs 1 output

Since verilog does not support passing of arrays as arguments, so the program will be written such that
there will be an Input Bus for input to a component and an Output Bus for output from a component.
The Input and Output bus will pack all the ports that are are connected to the input and output side of a component.
Eg.
if input has following ports:
	data_in[0], valid_in[0], ready_in[0]
	data_in[1], valid_in[1], ready_in[1]
	data_in[2], valid_in[2], ready_in[2]
	
then the input port will have the following input buses:
	data_in_bus -> {data_in[2], data_in[1], data_in[0]}
	valid_in_bus -> {valid_in[2], valid_in[1], valid_in[0]}
	ready_in_bus -> {ready_in[2], ready_in[1], ready_in[0]}
	
Similarly output buses will be created
