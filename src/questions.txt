Information about LSQ ports. What are in1:32*l0a kind of things?
Is join ever used? If yes then how is it any different from Merge?
What are TEHB and OEHB?
Can Branch have more than two Output ports? If it does, then what will + and - in output be replaced with?
Dores + mean that the input data will be sent to this output port if the condition is 1?

Verilog does not support arrays in port list. VHDL components are written with arrays in port list.
So currently, the VHDL components can not be connected to the Verilog top file.
So the best we can do is to pack all the Inputs/Outputs into respective Input Bus or Output Bus
then pass connect the bus to various components. Still we won't be able to connect it to the VHDL
file for now. This workaround will work only when all the code is written purely in Verilog!

Another solution might be to use SystemVerilog but I would frown upon that thought.

Input always comes at diffenert times in merge but can arrive at the same time in mux

June 9th:
What are Sext and Zext operations in Arithmetic Units?
Is it possible for any component to have different data_in_size and data_out_size?
What is antitoken in select entity in arithmetic units?
Ask About handshake protocol and do the simulation accordingly. Does ready signal go low as soon as a handshake happens?
What is the use of source? It is always followed by a Const.
